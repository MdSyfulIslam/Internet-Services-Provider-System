## 🔍 Project Overview

The **ISP System** is developed to address the operational complexities of internet service providers. It helps manage customer data, network mapping, staff records, and billing processes, all under a simple Java Swing-based GUI.

This project was developed for the **Algorithms Lab (CSE 206)** course at Green University of Bangladesh.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Add, delete, and view **customer** details
- ✅ Manage **staff** information with salary and joining date
- ✅ View **all registered users**
- 🧭 **Network Mapping Module**
  - Shortest path calculation
  - Minimum spanning tree setup *(coming soon)*
- 💰 **Billing module** *(under development)*
- 🖱 Simple and interactive Java Swing UI


---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

The project applies the following core algorithms and data structures:

- **HashMap** – For storing user and staff records
- **Graph Algorithms** *(Planned/Partial)*:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm – For shortest path
  - Kruskal’s Algorithm – For minimum spanning tree (planned)
- **Routing Optimization** – Path cost minimization (planned)

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing
- **IDE:**  NetBeans
- **Data Storage:** In-memory (HashMap)

**Hardware Requirements:**

- Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM
- 1920x1080 display resolution

**Software Requirements:**

- Java Development Kit (JDK 8+)
- Java Swing (for GUI)
- Windows 10

---

## 📊 Performance & Testing

All key modules were tested and yielded the following results:

- 🧑‍💼 **Customer Module:** Add/Retrieve/Delete in ~0.5s  
- 🧑‍💻 **Staff Module:** Retrieve performance ~0.3s  
- 🌐 **Mapping Interface:** Load time ~0.8s  

All functionalities were evaluated with valid and invalid input combinations for robustness. Mapping and billing features are in partial or planning phase.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- 💾 Integrate persistent storage (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- 🧮 Complete and optimize the **billing module**
- 🔐 Implement role-based **user authentication**
- 📡 Real-time **network monitoring dashboard**
- 🧪 Add form validation and error handling
- 🌍 Develop a **web-based** version using modern frameworks
